# Global-Sugar-Consumption-Trend-1960-2023-
This data-driven analysis explores global sugar consumption patterns from 1960 to 2023. It evaluates links between consumption and public health outcomes (e.g., diabetes, obesity) and economic factors like GDP, taxation, and education campaigns.
🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

📁 Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle
Data Coverage: 1960–2023

Contents:
Sugar consumption (total & per capita)
Obesity and diabetes rates
GDP, taxation, and subsidy indicators
Education campaign records
Region and income-based segmentation

🎯 Analytical Goals
Track trends in global and regional sugar consumption
Identify health correlations (diabetes, obesity)
Evaluate effectiveness of sugar taxes and education
Highlight vulnerable populations and regions
Support data-driven health and policy recommendations

🔍 Key Questions
How has sugar consumption changed globally over time?
What regional disparities exist in consumption?
What’s the link between sugar and obesity/diabetes?
Are taxation and education efforts effective?
Which populations are most affected by sugar overconsumption?

📈 Summary of Findings

🌎 Global Trend
Total sugar consumption (1960–2023): 56.5 trillion units
Peak: 2001, with gradual decline thereafter

🌐 Regional Comparison
Highest: Western Europe, East Asia, Australia & New Zealand
Lowest: Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern America

💰 Economic Influence
High consumption in lower-middle income groups
Taxation → Reduction: $301,926.06
Education → Reduction: $210,506.85

🏥 Health Correlation
Obesity correlation strongest in BMI 15–25 groups
Diabetes mirrored sugar consumption in high-availability regions

📊 Data Visuals & Techniques
Line graphs (year-over-year trends)
Bar & pie charts (region & pricing segmentation)
Heatmaps (regional distribution)
Excel tools: PivotTables, conditional formatting, charting

🧠 Additional Insights
Price Sensitivity: Most responsive among income levels 1.5–3.5
Urbanization Effect: Higher sugar in urban settings → policy target
Sustainability Gap: Sugarcane production pressures remain unaddressed
Policy Layering: Combining tax + education yields better results

✅ Key Observations
Multi-pronged interventions (education + taxation) are most effective
Middle-income populations are major sugar consumers
Regionally tailored policy matters

🧾 Recommendations
Expand health education campaigns in high-consumption regions
Implement/scale sugar taxation
Target public health in urban zones
Use income segmentation for focused interventions
Encourage data-backed nutrition planning

⚠️ Limitations
Post-2023 data projections are unavailable
Gaps in data from low-income regions
Food source types (e.g., soft drinks) not segmented

🌍 Case Study Highlights
Mexico (2014): Sugar tax → 6% drop in sugary drink purchases
UK (2015–2020): 29% drop in soft drink sugar content
Chile: Labels + tax = consumption shift

👥 Stakeholder Value
Policymakers: Develop data-informed nutrition regulations
Researchers: Understand socio-health-economic links
Healthcare Providers: Identify high-risk demographics
Industry Analysts: Track consumption and behavior trends

🔬 Future Exploration
Machine learning for predictive modeling
Impact of climate on sugar production
Include ultra-processed food patterns
Explore causality using time-series models

📌 Conclusion

This analysis highlights how sugar consumption influences health and economic outcomes globally. Using Excel-based methods, it demonstrates the importance of accessible, policy-oriented data analysis. For data scientists, this project showcases applied analysis, visual storytelling, and actionable insight generation for public health.
